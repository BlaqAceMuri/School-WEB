            <p>
                I hope it offers an insightful preview of a school which aims to provide its pupils and students with an
                excellent all round experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Castle High School is a special institution as not only is there a strong emphasis on education, there
                is a
                culture of treating all our pupils and students as individuals, providing life enhancing skills, a
                strong sense of community and Christian values. Its aim is to promote and ensure the development of
                upright, international citizens and provide a curriculum which ensures that this actually happens.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our teachers are committed to innovative teaching methods and the highest possible educational
                provision. They utilise various physical and virtual learning environments to support student learning
                while providing appropriate support and feedback. Consequently, our students find themselves in a warm,
                caring and nurturing environment which is student-centered and dedicated to helping them attain the
                highest standards.
                <br>
                <br>
